WvWOverlay
==========

GW2 WvW Overlay for the Overwolf Competition. 

Hello! Welcome to the 
Guild Wars 2 Scout Overlay!

The main purpose of this app is to provide easier communication between scouts and their respective server in World vs World.

To begin:
Open TeamSpeak and navigate to your channel
Click on options on the left to select your server and map
Click on select server and choose your current server
Choose the map you want to use from the dropdown
Finally, click on the map to set your scout waypoints!

Features Include:

Up to date WvW Map
RI Timer on flipped objectives
Ability to click the map to set a waypoint
Can also set an enemy spotted icon
Seamless Integration with TeamSpeak
Waypoints and enemy spotted icons are automatically updated for everyone using the app in the same teamspeak channel
You have the ability to see who placed what icon, and how long ago it was placed when you hover over it
You also have the ability to mute an annoying player directly from the app in the hover tooltip!
Icons are automatically removed after 60 seconds, or you can click on them to remove them from your map
Thank you so much for trying out my app.
